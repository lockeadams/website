# info
I choose to build my computer experience from the ground up -- starting with nothing but a tty after installing the OS.
This means that nearly every aspect of my system is customized to fit within my keyboard & terminal centric workflow while appearing aesthetically pleasing.
Customization is achieved through the editing of text files, commonly known as dotfiles.
If you'd like to view my configuraiton, it's available on my github [here](https://github.com/lockeadams/dotfiles).
