# about me
Hi, I'm Locke.
I'm a high school student from Georgia with a passion for solving problems and learning new things.
I paint house numbers on curbs for local neighborhoods to fund my hobbies of building PC's and restoring cars.
I also own way too many mechanical keyboards and Thinkpads.
In my free time I enjoy developing interesting software and ricing my linux desktop.
Sometimes I'll write code for robots, too.
My future goals include time travel and intergalactic exploration, but if that doesn't work out I'd like to develop technology to interface computers and our brains.

# about this site
This site is written from scratch (with the help of the internet) in Markdown and CSS.
It's generated using Jekyll and is hosted on an old laptop in my bedroom.
If you're interested in seeing my messy first attempt at web development, feel free to check out the [source code](https://github.com/lockeadams/website) on my Github.
