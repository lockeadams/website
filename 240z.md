# 1971 datsun 240z
Pictured above is my 1971 Datsun 240z in its current state.
I began restoring it in spring 2018, and hope to finish it up by fall 2019.
I'm hard at work reassembling the engine while the body is getting its final prep before paint at a local auto shop.
Stay tuned for pictures and more info once it's completed!
